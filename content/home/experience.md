        Improved BrewRight, ABI’s legal analytics platform for detecting fraudulent transactions for financial compliance
        
        * Developed machine learning models and implemented hypotheses to flag anomalous and risky transactions
        * Set-up CICD for DevOps pipelines, optimized API data extraction scripts and achieved E2E Automation
        * Migrated existing codebase to run in PySpark using Databricks; reducing runtime by 70%, saving USD 100,000
        
  - title: Summer Intern

        Worked on predicting the work in progress (WIP) stock of the assembly shop. 
        
        * Optimized the process by making it data driven and helped reduce the WIP stock by 9%
        * Reduced monthly production shift planning time by 80%

  - title: Research - Non-contact vibration analysis through video
    company: IIT Madras
    company_url: 'https://www.ab-inbev.com/'
    company_logo: org-gc
    location: Chennai, India
    date_start: '2019-10-03'
    date_end: '2020-06-16'
    description: |2-
        Showcased video cameras as a quick and inexpensive way for remote, non-contact vibration analysis
        
        * Scale invariant features and optical flow algorithms used to extract the motion signal from the video frames
        * The peaks obtained from FFT plots generated using the motion signal were found to be in 8% of the body’s NF


  - title: Pneumonia Detection in X-Rays
    company: Astrazeneca-IITM Hackathon
    company_url: 'https://www.ab-inbev.com/'
    company_logo: org-gc
    location: Bangalore, India
    date_start: '2020-01-03'
    date_end: '2020-01-03'
    description: |2-
        AI based hackathon to diagnose pneumonia through abscesses or pleural effusions in X-Ray images 
        
        * Tackled as an object detection problem, with only one type of image to detect. Yolo-v3 from Darknet was used 
        * Achieved an IoU of 46.97% and MAP value of 35.44%.


  - title: Research - Monsoon Rainfall Prediction
    company: IIT Madras
    company_url: 'https://www.ab-inbev.com/'
    company_logo: org-gc
    location: Chennai, India
    date_start: '2019-07-03'
    date_end: '2019-11-16'
    description: |2-
        Developed an ML model for prediction of Indian rainfall on monthly and seasonal time scales
        
        * Used RNNs to forecast rainfall for June to Sept (ISMR) by feeding data on rainfall and sea surface temps
        * Set-up CICD for DevOps pipelines, optimized API data extraction scripts and achieved E2E Automation
        * Temperature was used to augment, accounting for the fluctuations; the model achieved an RMS Error of 24 cm

  - title: Project - Quality Prediction in Iron Ore Mining using Machine Learning
    company: IIT Madras
    company_url: 'https://www.ab-inbev.com/'
    company_logo: org-gc
    location: Chennai, India
    date_start: '2019-01-03'

        Specifics - 
        
        * Created a machine learning based model to predict purity of the Iron ore (percentage of Silica Impurity) prior to froth floatation, to enable engineers to take corrective actions and ensure that the product quality remains high
        * The model employed random forest classifiers, neural networks and XGBoost in an ensemble to predict the output Silica concentrate based on input ore properties, ore pulp condition, air flow rate &amp; other process parameters
        * The predicted value of silica concentrate in the ore was found have an R2 score of 0.941 in the testing set
